Weatherly Planner
An application that can showcase the weather and the Pollution Standard Index (PSI) and allow you to schedule your events accordingly. 
This would be able to tell whether the weather and the environment is safe for travelling out of home or whether there is a necessity to wear a mask or bring an umbrella. This also reduces the inconvenience the users have 

Design Process
Background: I decided to use blurred skies backgrounds of different colours. Firstly, I wanted it to be blurred because it would be easier to read words and not be distracted by the background. Secondly, I wanted the background to be skies because skies usually depict weather.

I wanted to have a minimalistic feel of my page because these days many applications are very minimal and straightforward, making it easy for users to use and adapt.This would attract more people to use my application feature as if other people find it easy and efficient to usse, by word of mouth, more people would be attracted to use this application. I wanted it to be straightforward and information are all accessed easily and just a click of a button. 

The website is for everyone to use especially for those who go out frequently, this will help them take note of the precuations during that event on that day. 

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to have information presented to me as simply as possible. 
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

Features
The application has 4 main features.
First, there is a menu page, users can use this menu page to go to each individual specific feature more easily as they can navigate around.
Secondly, there is the weather forecast page where that would tell you the weather in the week ahead.
Thirdly, the next feature can showcase the haze pollution standard index (psi) which will indicate whether there is a need to wear a mask on that day or not.
Lastly, the planner feature will help to take down events that are happening on each day and the application will update a notification if there is precautions to take on that day. 

Existing Features
Navigation Bar: Users can tap the home page, the weather forecast, the PSI tracker and the planner easily which is located at the top of the page.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Technologies Users
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
