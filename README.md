**Weather & PSI Forecast Tracker:**
An application feature / website that can showcase the weather and the Pollution Standard Index (PSI).
This would be able to tell whether the weather and the environment is safe for travelling out of home or whether there is a necessity to wear a mask or bring an umbrella.

**Design Process:**
_Background:_
I decided to use blurred skies backgrounds of different colours. Firstly, I wanted it to be blurred because it would be easier to read words and not be distracted by the background. Secondly, I wanted the background to be skies because skies usually depict weather.

_Tables:_
I wanted to make it easily accessible through both mobile, tablets and the web.
I wanted to have a minimalistic feel of my page because these days many applications are very minimal and straightforward, making it easy for users to use and adapt at just a click of a button.

This would attract more people to use my website / application feature as if other people find it easy and efficient to usse, by word of mouth, more people would be attracted to use this website / application feature.

The website is for everyone to use especially for those who go out frequently, this will help them take note of the precuations during that event on that day. 

**User Stories:**

As someone who has friends who love to go outside and plan gatherings, I notice they don't always come prepared like, sometimes, our gatherings would be interrupted due to a heavy downpour and none of us are prepared.

This website / application feature could be used such that poeple who love to go out to be prepared in advance with as little trouble as possible. 
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

<!-- As a user type, I want to have information presented to me as simply as possible.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. -->

**Features:**
**_Main Features:_**
The website / application feature has 4 main features.
_Menu page:_ Users can use this menu page to go to each individual specific feature more easily as they can navigate around.
_Weather Forecast Page:_ Users would find out the weather in the week ahead.
_PSI Tracker Page:_ Users can see the haze pollution standard index levels and consider if there is a need to wear a mask on that day or not.
_Feedback Page:_ Users can input their recommendations to implement in this website / application feature for the developers and input their information for the developers to reach out and contact them.

**_Side Features:_**
_Navigation Bar:_ Users can tap the home page, the weather forecast, the PSI tracker and the planner easily which is located at the top of the page.
_Buttons:_ Users can tap on the buttons in the menu page to be led on to different various pages in the website / application feature

Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z

**_Features Left to Implement:_**
I want to implement 

**Ideas for features:**
<!-- Technologies Users
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used. -->

**JQuery:**
<!-- The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as: -->

**Contact form:**
<!-- Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet. 

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here. -->
