Weatherly Planner
An application that can showcase the weather and the Pollution Standard Index (PSI) and allow you to schedule your events accordingly. 
This would be able to tell whether the weather and the environment is safe for travelling out of home or whether there is a necessity to wear a mask or bring an umbrella. This also reduces the inconvenience the users have 

Design Process
Background: I decided to use blurred skies backgrounds of different colours. Firstly, I wanted it to be blurred because it would be easier to read words and not be distracted by the background. Secondly, I wanted the background to be skies because skies usually depict weather.
I wanted to have a minimalistic feel of my page because these days many applications are very minimal and straightforward, making it easy for users to use and adapt. This would attract more people to use my application feature as if other people find it easy and efficient to usse, by word of mouth, more people would be attracted to use this application. 
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
